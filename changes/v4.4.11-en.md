### Enhancements

- OTP upgrade from 24.1.5-3 to 24.3.4.2-1 [#9265](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9265).
  Change highlights:
    - Erlang/OTP [SSL library vulnerability fix](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37026)
    - Added support for OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) Stapling
    - Added CRL (Certificate Revocation List) cache auto refresh

- Added support for OCSP stapling and CRL
  caching [#9297](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9297).

- Added support for specifying custom modules for adding clientid and common name
  aliases [#9297](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9297).
  Now you can implement a simple callback to enrich clients with aliases, and then use the aliases
  in the authentication and authorization (ACL) rules' place holders (`%cida` for clientid alias
  and `%cna` for username alias).

- Added support for specifying custom modules for custom authentication [#9297](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9297).
  To support simple authentication rules, it is no longer necessary to implement a full-blown plugin.

- Added a JWT management for Rule-Engine, for creating and refreshing JWT tokens in rule engine actions [#9241](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9241).
  This feature is so far only used in EMQX Enterprise Google PubSub integration.
  Can be used as webhook integration's JWT authentication against the webhook service endpoint.

- Update `gen_rpc` dependency to 3.0.0.
