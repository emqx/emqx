### Enhancements

- Add a warning log if the ACL check failed for subscription [#9124](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9124).
  This is to make the ACL deny logging for subscription behave the same as for publish.

### Bug fixes

- Improve the display of rule's 'Maximum Speed' counter to only reserve 2 decimal places. [#9185](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9185)
  This is to avoid displaying floats like `0.30000000000000004` on the dashboard.

- Fix the issue that emqx prints too many error logs when connecting to mongodb but auth failed. [#9184](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9184)

- Fix that after receiving publish in `idle mode` the emqx-sn gateway may panic [#9024](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9024).

- "Pause due to rate limit" log level demoted from warning to notice [#9134](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9134).

- Restore old `emqx_auth_jwt` module API, so the hook callback functions registered in older version will not be invalidated after hot-upgrade [#9144](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9144).

- Fixed the response status code for the `/status` endpoint [#9210](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9210). 
  Before the fix, it always returned `200` even if the EMQX application was not running.  Now it returns `503` in that case.
