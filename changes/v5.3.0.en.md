# v5.3.0

## Enhancements

- [#11597](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11597) Upgraded ekka to 0.15.13, which incorporates the following changes:
  - Upgraded Mria to 0.6.2.
  - Introduced the ability to configure the bootstrap data sync batch size, as detailed in [Mria PR](https://github.com/emqx/mria/pull/159).
  - Enhanced the reliability of mria_membership processes, as described in [Mria PR](https://github.com/emqx/mria/pull/156).
  - Fix log message formatting error.
  - Added `node.default_bootstrap_batch_size` option to EMQX configuration.
  Increasing the value of this option can greatly reduce a replicant node startup time, especially when the EMQX cluster interconnect network latency is high and the EMQX built-in database holds a large amount of data, e.g. when the number of subscriptions is high.
- [#11620](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11620) Added a new rule-engine SQL function `bytesize` to get the size of a byte-string. e.g. `SELECT * FROM "t/#" WHERE bytesize(payload) > 10`.
- [#11642](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11642) Updated to quicer version 0.0.200 in preparation for enabling openssl3 support for QUIC transport.

- [#11661](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11661) Fixed log formatter when log.HANDLER.formatter is set to 'json'. The bug was introduced in v5.0.4 where the log line was no longer a valid JSON, but prefixed with timestamp string and level name.
