Changed interfaces of Message Streams and Message Queues.

For subscribing to streams, `$stream` prefix is now used. Also, streams become named, and the name should be specified on subscribe: `SUBSCRIBE $stream/<name>/<topic_filter>` or (`SUBSCRIBE $stream/<name>` if the stream is known to exist). The starting point for stream consumption is specified using `stream-offset` user subscription property.

For subscribing to message queues, `$queue` prefix is used. Message queues also become named, and the name should be specified on subscribe: `SUBSCRIBE $queue/<name>/<topic_filter>` or (`SUBSCRIBE $queue/<name>` if the queue is known to exist).

Notes:
* Stream and queue names may contain only alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and dots.
* Previously created unnamed streams and queues obtain the name derived from their topic filter. Their name becomes their topic filter with prepended `/`.
* `$s` and `$q` prefixes are still supported for subscribing to legacy streams and queues but are considered deprecated.
* If Message Queues are enabled, `$queue` prefix cannot be used for subscribing to shared subscriptions anymore.
