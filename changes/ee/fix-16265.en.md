Previously, the Kafka source connector performed health checks by verifying partition leader connectivity for all partitions.
In a clustered deployment, each EMQX node is assigned only a subset of partitions, causing leader connections for unassigned partitions to remain idle.
Since Kafka closes idle connections after a timeout (10 minutes by default), this behavior could trigger false connectivity alarms.

The health check now verifies leader connectivity only for the partitions assigned to the current EMQX node, preventing unnecessary idle connections and false alarms.
