Port JT/T 808 gateway features and fixes from release-510 to release-60.

<!-- from PR #16220 -->
- Added the `jt808.frame.parse_unknown_message` option, enabling the JT808 gateway to transparently forward unknown messages.

<!-- from PR #16596 -->
- Add JT/T 808 protocol 2019 support.

<!-- from PR #16609 -->
- Fixed JT/T 808 gateway parameter setting (0x8103) and query response (0x0104) message handling for CAN bus ID parameters (0x0110~0x01FF), which should use BYTE[8] data type with base64 encoding in JSON instead of string type.

<!-- from PR #16627 -->
- Add GBK character encoding support for JT/T 808 gateway.

  The JT/T 808 protocol specifies GBK encoding for STRING type fields. A new `frame.string_encoding` configuration option is added:
  - `utf8` (default): Pass through strings as-is (backward-compatible)
  - `gbk`: Convert GBK-encoded strings from devices to UTF-8 for MQTT, and UTF-8 from MQTT to GBK for devices

  This affects string fields including license plates, driver names, text messages, area names, and client parameters.
  MQTT payloads always use UTF-8 encoding regardless of this setting.

- Added support for custom `msg_sn` in JT/T 808 gateway downlink messages.

  When a downlink MQTT message payload contains a `msg_sn` field in the header, the gateway will use that value instead of the auto-generated channel sequence number. This allows external systems to control message sequencing for specific use cases.

<!-- from PR #16655 -->
- Fixed JT/T 808 gateway `string_encoding` not applied to downlink message serialization.

  Previously, the `string_encoding` configuration (e.g., `gbk`) was only used for parsing uplink messages, but not for serializing downlink messages. Now when `string_encoding: gbk` is configured, both uplink parsing (GBK to UTF-8) and downlink serialization (UTF-8 to GBK) work correctly.

<!-- from PR #16619 -->
- Fixed JT/T 808 0x0702 driver identity report message parsing.
