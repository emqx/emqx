Fixed an issue where Sparkplug B metrics alias mapping feature would not work if an EMQX node was upgraded from 5.10.x to 6.0.y.  This has been fixed.

Due to differences in the way that Protobuf code was generated prior to 6.0.0, if an EMQX node started running in an older (< 6.0.0) version with the same OTP version as the newer version (in this case, upgraded from 5.10.x to 6.0.y), then the cached Protobuf code was kept but the newer code had different expectations from it.  This led to the Sparkplug B alias mapping to not work in this scenario.
