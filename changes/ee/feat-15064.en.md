New Experimental cluster Linear Session Registry (LSR)

Added support for handling large-scale client reconnections. 
This feature prioritizes accepting the most recent client connection attempt over rejecting it in favor of older connections.

Enable the feature by configuring:

```
broker.enable_linear_session_registry = true
broker.enable_session_registry = false
```

Note: The feature is disabled by default and has the following limitations:  

- EMQX cluster nodes require precise time synchronization (time difference < 5ms) for accurate operation.  

- Channel registry history is not supported.

Untested Scenarios:

- Limited to MQTT connections; other transport or gateway protocols are untested.  

- Tested only with in-memory sessions, not durable storage.  

- Node evacuation with older EMQX versions has not been tested.
