New Experimental cluster Linear Session Registry (LSR)

Added support for handling large-scale client reconnections. 
This feature prioritizes accepting the most recent client connection attempt over rejecting it in favor of older connections.

Enable the feature by configuring:

```
broker.linear_session_registry = enabled
```

Note: The feature is disabled by default and has the following limitations:

- EMQX cluster nodes require precise time synchronization (time difference < 5ms) for accurate operation.

- Channel registry history is not supported.

- Websocket is unsupported.

Future works

- Add tests for the durable session.

- Enable the Node Evacuation feature to facilitate rolling upgrades from clusters where LSR is disabled or not supported.
