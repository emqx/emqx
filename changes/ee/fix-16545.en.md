Fixed `node.cookie` handling of `#` character. Previously, if the cookie contained `#`, only the prefix before `#` would take effect.
For example, if `abc#d` was configured, only `abc` was used as the cookie.

Added validation to reject problematic characters: backslash, single quote, double quote, and space.
