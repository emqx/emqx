Upgrades the underlying runtime system from Erlang/OTP 27 to Erlang/OTP 28.
This major upgrade brings performance improvements for TLS.

- Major TLS/SSL Performance Boost.
  Higher Throughput: Heavily optimized TLS handling reduces CPU usage for secure connections (MQTTS/WSS).

- Better Flow Control: New user-space buffering prevents connection spikes from overwhelming system memory.
