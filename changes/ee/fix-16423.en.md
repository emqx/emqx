Added support for verifying the 'aud' (audience) claim in JWT authentication.

When the 'aud' claim is configured in verify_claims, the JWT token must include a valid 'aud' claim. The verification supports both string and array formats:

- If 'aud' is a string, it must exactly match the expected value.
- If 'aud' is an array, at least one element in the array must match the expected value.
- Empty string or empty array will fail verification.
- Missing 'aud' claim will fail verification when it's configured in verify_claims.
