Fix redis cluster failover issue.

Previously, EMQX’s Redis cluster client only refreshed the cluster topology when regular queries (e.g., GET) failed. However, periodic PING commands did not trigger a refresh when they failed.
This could cause the connector to remain in a “connecting” state and keep using outdated topology information if no new queries were made after a failover.
With this fix, failed `PING` responses now trigger a cluster topology refresh, ensuring that connector management promptly recovers and updates its view of the Redis cluster after failovers.
