Fixed an issue where not all retained messages would be delivered if a subscriber hit the retained message dispatch rate limit.

If the dispatch rate limit is reached while iterating over retained topics, then the client process will retry the iteration at a later time with exponential back-off (minimum 300 ms, maximum 10 s).
