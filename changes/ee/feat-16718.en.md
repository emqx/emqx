Improve Dashboard Swagger i18n behavior for API operation docs.

Operation `summary` is now derived from the i18n `label` of the same `?DESC(...)` reference used by operation `description`, so API modules can keep operation docs in `desc/description` only.

This also standardizes and expands i18n coverage for operation metadata and example summaries across multiple API modules.
