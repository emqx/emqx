Now, in GreptimeDB and EMQX Tables Actions, integer values that are not suffixed with `i` or `u` are automatically cast to float (`float64`) values before being sent to the database.

In InfluxDB Write Syntax, float is the default numeric type, and integers must be annotated.  Previously, when EMQX encountered a non-annotated integer, it would interpret it as an one-character string, and insertion would fail if the column was of type float.
