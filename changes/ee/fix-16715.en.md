Fixed an issue where retained `$SYS` messages (for example, broker/node identity topics) were stored without expiry, which could leave stale node identifiers visible in Dashboard views after StatefulSet rotation.

Now, newly published retained `$SYS` messages include `Message-Expiry-Interval = 3600` (1 hour).

For already existing stale retained `$SYS` entries created before this change, you can manually clear them by publishing an empty retained message to the stale topic:

```bash
emqx eval 'emqx:publish(emqx_message:set_flag(retain, true, emqx_message:make(emqx_sys, <<"$SYS/brokers/emqx@127.0.0.1/sysdescr">>, <<>>))).'
```

Replace the topic in the command with the stale `$SYS/...` topic you want to remove.
