Fixed a crash in `emqx ctl subscriptions list` that could happen when shared subscriptions were present.

Before this fix, listing subscriptions could fail for some clients and return no output.

After this fix, `emqx ctl subscriptions list` works reliably with both regular and shared subscriptions.
