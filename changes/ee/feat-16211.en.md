Clients in managed namespaces will bump the namespaced metrics above, as well as continue to bump the usual global metrics.

These metrics are exposed in Prometheus format to be scraped from the `GET /prometheus/ns/stats` endpoint.  By specifying the `ns=NAMESPACE` query parameter, only data from `NAMESPACE` will be returned.  Omitting this parameters causes data from all namespaces to be scraped.  Namespaces are added as labels to metrics.
