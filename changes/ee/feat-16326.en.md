Implemented Message Streams.

Message Streams are durable collections of messages identified by a topic filter.
They have an explicit lifecycle, and any published message that matches the Stream’s topic filter is automatically appended to the stream.
Streams allow consumption of messages with ordering guarantees and can be consumed multiple times.
To consume messages from a stream, clients can subscribe to a special topic of the form
`$s/<timestamp>/topic/filter`, where `topic/filter` refers to an existing Stream. Subscribing with a timestamp allows consumption to begin at a specific point in time. The timestamp may be a Unix timestamp in microseconds or one of two special values: `earliest` or `latest`.
