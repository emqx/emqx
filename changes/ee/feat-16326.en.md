Implemented Message Streams.

Message Streams are collections of messages identified by `topic/filter`.
Message Streams have an explicit lifecycle and are automatically replenished with published messages matched with the stream's topic filter during the stream's lifetime.

Streams allow repetitive and consumption of messages with ordering guarantees.

Clients may subscribe to a special topic of the form `$s/<timestamp>/topic/filter` to consume messages from the stream
starting from the given timestamp. The timestamp may be a unix timestamp in microseconds or take one of special values,
`earliest` or `latest`.
