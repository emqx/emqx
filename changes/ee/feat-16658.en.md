Previously, when the server port was omitted in an EMQX Tables Connector, the port would default to 80.  Now, it defaults to 4001.

A more intelligible error message is returned when an EMQX Tables Connector is configured with SSL enabled but `cacertfile`, `certfile` or `keyfile` configurations are missing.
