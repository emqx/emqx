Add GBK character encoding support for JT/T 808 gateway.

The JT/T 808 protocol specifies GBK encoding for STRING type fields. A new `frame.string_encoding` configuration option is added:
- `utf8` (default): Pass through strings as-is (backward-compatible)
- `gbk`: Convert GBK-encoded strings from devices to UTF-8 for MQTT, and UTF-8 from MQTT to GBK for devices

This affects string fields including license plates, driver names, text messages, area names, and client parameters.
MQTT payloads always use UTF-8 encoding regardless of this setting.
