Now, global admin users will see resources from all namespaces (by default) when listing namespaced resources (connectors/sources/actions/rules).  They may focus on one particular namespace when performing CRUD operations by passing the `ns=NS` query parameter.  If they want to list only the global namespace resources, they omit `ns` and pass `only_global=true` query parameter.  Namespaced resources now return the `namespace` field to denote where they come from, with `namespace` being `null` for global resources to distinguish them from a potential namespace called `"global"`.
