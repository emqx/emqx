Corrected handling of `{allow|deny, all}` ACL rules.

Previously, these rules were internally translated to match `#`, which incorrectly failed to match topics prefixed with `$` (e.g. `$testtopic/1`) due to MQTT spec restrictions.
Now, a special internal value is used to ensure `{allow|deny, all}` rules correctly match any topic, including `$`-prefixed ones.
