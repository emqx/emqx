Added support for keeping track of metric aliases when utilizing the `spb_decode` Rule Engine function.

Now, after a device or edge of network (EoN) node publishes its `DBIRTH`/`NBIRTH` messages, alias mappings in said message will be stored and used when the client later uses `spb_decode` on a message matching the `DDATA`/`NDATA` topic patterns.  The original names of the metrics will be added to the output of `spb_decode`.

Note: when executing fallback actions, the mapping is not available in the environment they run in.  This means that, if a fallback action republishes the undecoded `DDATA`/`NDATA` payload to a Sparkplug B `DDATA`/`NDATA` topic, the metric `name` fields will not be populated by the alias mapping.
