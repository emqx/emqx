Added support for keeping track of metric aliases when utilizing the `spb_decode` Rule Engine function.

Now, after a device or edge of network (EoN) node publishes its `DBIRTH`/`NBIRTH` messages, alias mappings in said message will be stored and used when the client later uses `spb_decode` on a message matching the `DDATA`/`NDATA` topic patterns.  The original names of the metrics will be added to the output of `spb_decode`.
