- Added support for custom `msg_sn` in JT/T 808 gateway downlink messages.

When a downlink MQTT message payload contains a `msg_sn` field in the header, the gateway will use that value instead of the auto-generated channel sequence number. This allows external systems to control message sequencing for specific use cases.

- Fixed JT/T 808 gateway `string_encoding` not applied to downlink message serialization.

Previously, the `string_encoding` configuration (e.g., `gbk`) was only used for parsing uplink messages, but not for serializing downlink messages. Now when `string_encoding: gbk` is configured, both uplink parsing (GBK to UTF-8) and downlink serialization (UTF-8 to GBK) work correctly.
