Added the `allow_auto_topic_creation` configuration option to the Kafka producer connector.
When the Kafka server has `auto.create.topics.enable` set to `true`, and Kafka producer connector is configured with `allow_auto_topic_creation=true`, the metadata requests will be sent to trigger topic creation.

Remove Kafka producer linger time when the buffer queue is in memory mode, now linger only happens when producer is buffering data to disk.
