Fixed QoS 2 duplicate handling when `await_rel_timeout` has expired.

Previously, if a client retried a QoS 2 `PUBLISH` with `DUP=1` after the broker had expired the pending PUBREL state (default 300 seconds), the message could be published to subscribers again. EMQX now treats this retransmission as a duplicate handshake packet and returns `PUBREC` without re-delivering the application message.
