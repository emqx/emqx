Improvements and bug fixes related to durable storage feature.

- Improved handling of configuration inconsistencies between the nodes.

  Previously, when a durable storage was created in a cluster where
  nodes had different initial durable storage configuration, the
  replicas wound not converge. This change addresses this problem by
  replicating the configuration of the shard leader node to the
  replicas during initialization of the storage and subsequent
  configuration changes.

  Warning: this change is not backward-compatible. During a rolling
  cluster upgrade the shards will pause until the majority of their
  replicas are upgraded to the new version of EMQX, after which
  downgrade to the previous versions of EMQX will become impossible.

- Fixed an issue in the durable storage subscription mechanism.

  Previously, a durable subscription created with a fresh iterator
  could miss a stored message with the timestamp precisely matching
  timestamp of the iterator.
