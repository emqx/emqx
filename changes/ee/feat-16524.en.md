Enhanced base64 encoding and decoding functions in rule engine SQL with support for padding and URL-safe options.

The `base64_encode` and `base64_decode` functions now support optional parameters to control encoding behavior:

- **`no_padding`**: Encode or decode without padding characters (`=`). Useful when you need to remove padding from encoded strings or decode strings that don't have padding.
- **`urlsafe`**: Use URL-safe base64 encoding/decoding. Replaces `+` with `-` and `/` with `_`, making the encoded string safe to use in URLs without encoding.

You can use these options individually or combine them. When combining options, the order doesn't matter.

**Examples in rule SQL:**

Encode without padding:
```sql
SELECT base64_encode(payload, 'no_padding') as encoded FROM "t/#"
```

Encode with URL-safe characters:
```sql
SELECT base64_encode(payload, 'urlsafe') as encoded FROM "t/#"
```

Encode with both options (no padding and URL-safe):
```sql
SELECT base64_encode(payload, 'no_padding', 'urlsafe') as encoded FROM "t/#"
```

Decode URL-safe base64:
```sql
SELECT base64_decode(payload, 'urlsafe') as decoded FROM "t/#"
```

Decode unpadded URL-safe base64:
```sql
SELECT base64_decode(payload, 'urlsafe', 'no_padding') as decoded FROM "t/#"
```
