Added support for file references in GCP Pub/Sub and BigQuery `service_account_json` configuration fields.

The service account credentials can now be provided in two ways:
- Inline: Paste the entire JSON content directly (existing behavior)
- File reference: Use `file://path/to/service_account.json` to reference a file containing the credentials
