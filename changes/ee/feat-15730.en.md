Added support for overriding clientid using authentication results.  If a backend returns a `clientid_override` attribute in its successful authentication result, it'll replace the connecting client's clientid.

Backends/methods supporting setting `clientid_override` in the authentication result to
override clientid:

- HTTP
- JWT
- LDAP
- MongoDB
- MySQL
- Postgres
- Redis
