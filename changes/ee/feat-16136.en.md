Improved resource management and performance for durable storage.

Introduced a concept of durable storage database group.
Certain resources (such as memtable size and disk usage quota) can be shared between the group members.

Added the following new metrics (per DB group):

- `emqx_ds_disk_usage`: Total size of SST files
- `emqx_ds_write_buffer_memory_usage`: RocksDB memtable size
- `emqx_ds_total_trash_size`: Disk usage by trash SST files

Added the following group configurations:

- `durable_storage.db_groups.<group>.storage_quota`: Soft quota for the SST files size
- `durable_storage.db_groups.<group>.write_buffer_size`: Maximum memtable size
- `durable_storage.db_groups.<group>.rocksdb_nthreads_high` and `durable_storage.db_groups.<group>.rocksdb_nthreads_low`:
  Size of RocksDB thread pools.

Added a new alarm that is raised when the quota is exceeded: `db_storage_quota_exceeded:<DB>`.
Please refer to the "Storage Quota" section of the documentation for more details.

Default session checkpoint interval has been changed to 15s.
