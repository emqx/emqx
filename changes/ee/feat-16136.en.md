Improved resource management for durable storage.

Introduced a concept of durable storage database group.
Certain resources (such as memtable size and disk usage quota) can be shared between the group members.

Added the following new metrics (per DB group):

- `emqx_ds_disk_usage`: Total size of SST files
- `emqx_ds_write_buffer_memory_usage`: RocksDB memtable size
- `emqx_ds_total_trash_size`: Disk usage by trash SST files

Added the following group configurations:

- `durable_storage.db_groups.<group>.storage_quota`: Soft quota for the SST files size
- `durable_storage.db_groups.<group>.write_buffer_size`: Maximum memtable size

Default session checkpoint interval has been changed to 15s.
