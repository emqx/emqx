Improve handling of recoverable errors in the durable session.
Durable sessions will now retry creation of durable storage iterators when that operation fails due to network issue.
Previously, the whole session would get disconnected.

Fix problem with the retry mechanism in the `emqx_ds_client` component.
Previously, the number of retry attempts on recoverable errors was limited.

Fix problems with the shared subscriptions:
- Fix problem with shared subscription leader not coming up after node restart.
- Shared subscription leader no longer advertises streams that reached the end of replay to the clients.
- Make shared sub leader state checkpoint transaction options configurable
