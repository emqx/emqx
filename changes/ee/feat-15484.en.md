Changed our build system so that all packages are build with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)'s [Mix](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/introduction-to-mix.html), so that all now ship with Elixir support.  This opens up EMQX to Elixir community and allows us to use Elixir dependencies when required, besides enabling use of [IEx](https://hexdocs.pm/iex/IEx.html) as a better EMQX console.
