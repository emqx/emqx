Fixed an issue where, when importing configuration from an older node version into a newer one, values would not be upgraded according to newer code, leading to strange behavior.

One such example is importing a MQTT Connector with static clientids from 5.10.0 into 6.0.0.  In 5.10.0, usernames and passwords could not be associated with particular static clientids, and this was represented internally in a certain way.  Later versions added the capability of creating those associations, with a different internal representation.  This subtle internal representation conversion was missing when importing such configurations in previous EMQX versions.
