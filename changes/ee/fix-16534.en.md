Lowered the default `net_ticktime` from 2 minutes to 1 minute to improve cluster node failure detection.

In the event of a network outage or abrupt node termination, remaining nodes will detect the down node sooner,
reducing the time before failover mechanisms activate and improving overall cluster resilience and user experience.
