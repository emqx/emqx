Upgrade Kafka producer lib wollf to 4.0.12 to improve handling of temporarily missing partitions in Kafka metadata responses.

In rare race conditions, Kafka may return an incomplete partition list.
Previously, this was only handled when a topic was recreated with fewer partitions, but not when partitions were temporarily missing.
This gap could cause the partition producer to stall and block shutdown indefinitely.
