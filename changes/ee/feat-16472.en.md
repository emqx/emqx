Added a new configuration option `namespace_as_mountpoint` to enable automatic topic isolation using client namespaces.
When enabled, EMQX uses the client's namespace (from `client_attrs.tns`) as a topic mountpoint if no mountpoint is configured on the listener.
Topics are automatically prefixed with the namespace for PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, and Will messages, and the prefix is stripped when delivering messages to clients.
This setting is ignored if the listener already has a mountpoint configured, ensuring existing configurations take precedence.
