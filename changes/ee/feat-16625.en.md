Added configuration options `idp_signs_envelopes` and `idp_signs_assertions` to SAML SSO backend to control signature verification behavior.

Previously, SAML signature verification was not working correctly because the IdP certificate fingerprint was not being extracted from metadata and passed to esaml for verification.
This fix ensures proper signature validation of SAML responses from the Identity Provider.
