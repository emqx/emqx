Added configuration options `idp_signs_envelopes` and `idp_signs_assertions` to SAML SSO backend to control signature verification behavior.

Previously, SAML signature verification was not working correctly because the IdP certificate fingerprint was not being extracted from metadata and passed to esaml for verification.

Both options default to `false` for backwards compatibility with existing configurations. Users who want to enable signature verification should explicitly set these to `true` when their IdP is configured to sign SAML responses.
