When using an older MQTT Connector configuration with static clientids (from 5.10.0 and earlier) on later EMQX versions, the username and password at the root of the configuration was ignored.  This could cause trouble when upgrading and keeping the same configuration, as the MQTT clients would stop using the credentials.

Now, if there are username and/or password fields in the root Connector, those credentials are merged with any specific ones specified per clientid, the latter taking precedence.
