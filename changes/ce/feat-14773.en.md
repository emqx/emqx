Improved rate-limiting functionality (`bytes_rate`, `messages_rate`, `max_conn_rate` configured for zones or listeners).
* The rate-limiting algorithm is simplified to work more predictably. It does not try to impose backpressure on the client(s). Instead, it drops the messages. For QoS1/QoS2 messages the appropriate reason code is also returned.
* Rate limiting now allows reconfiguration at runtime.
* Rate limiting configuration now allows to specify window size and limit per each window explicitly:
`messages_rate = "300/5m"` means 300 messages per 5 minutes (with any possible fluctuation within this period),
while `messages_rate = "10/10s"` means 10 messages per 10 seconds. Although the configured RPS is the same, the latter variant is much more strict about fluctuations in the actual rate.
* Burst rate is provided via the `messages_burst`, `bytes_burst`, `max_conn_burst` zone and listener options. The burst value `messages_burst = 1000/h` means a client can send 1000 additional messages each hour without applying rate limiting.
