Implement log throttling. The feature reduces the number of potentially flooding logged events by
dropping all but the first event within a configured time window.
Throttling is applied to the following log events:
 - authentication_failure,
 - authorization_permission_denied,
 - cannot_publish_to_topic_due_to_not_authorized,
 - cannot_publish_to_topic_due_to_quota_exceeded,
 - connection_rejected_due_to_license_limit_reached,
 - dropped_msg_due_to_mqueue_is_full.
