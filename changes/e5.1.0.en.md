# e5.1.0

## Enhancements

- [#10584](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10584) Add log level configuration to SSL communication

- [#10598](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10598) Provide a callback method of Unary type in ExProto to avoid possible message disorder issues.

- [#10676](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10676) Implement configuration and user data import/export CLI.

  The `emqx ctl export` and `emqx ctl import` commands allow to export configuration and built-in database
  data from a running EMQX cluster and later import it to the same or another running EMQX cluster.

- [#10702](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10702) Introduce a more straightforward configuration option `keepalive_multiplier` and
  deprecate the old `keepalive_backoff` configuration.
  After this enhancement, EMQX checks the client's keepalive timeout status
  period by multiplying the "Client Requested Keepalive Interval" with `keepalive_multiplier`.

- [#10782](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10782) Added a new `deliver_rate` option to the retainer configuration, which can limit the maximum delivery rate per session in the retainer.


- [#10858](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10858) A new utility function timezone_to_offset_seconds/1 has been added to the rule engine SQL language. This function converts a timezone string (for example, "+02:00", "Z" and "local") to the corresponding offset in seconds.

- [#10909](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10909) Remove the deprecated HTTP APIs for gateways

- [#10910](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10910) The data bridge resource option `auto_restart_interval` was deprecated in favor of `health_check_interval`, and `request_timeout` was renamed to `request_ttl`.  Also, the default `request_ttl` value went from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

  The previous existence of both `auto_restart_interval` and `health_check_interval` was a source of confusion, as both parameters influenced the recovery of data bridges under failures.  An inconsistent configuration of those two parameters could lead to messages being expired without a chance to retry.  Now, `health_check_interval` is used both to control the periodicity of health checks that may transition the data bridge into `disconnected` or `connecting` states, as well as recovering from `disconnected`.

- [#10926](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10926) Allow 'enable' as well as 'enabled' as the state flag for listeners.

  Prior to this change, listener can be enable/disabled by setting the 'true' or 'false' on the 'enabled' config.
  This is slightly different naming comparing to other state flags in the system.
  No the 'enable' flag is added as an aliase on listeners.

- [#10929](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10929) Upgrade Erlang/OTP to 25.3.2-1

- [#10933](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10933) Add support for configuring TCP keep-alive in MQTT/TCP and MQTT/SSL listeners

- [#10948](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10948) Add `live_connections` field for some HTTP APIs, i.e:
  - `/monitor_current`, `/monitor_current/nodes/{node}`
  - `/monitor/nodes/{node}`, `/monitor`
  - `/node/{node}`, `/nodes`

- [#10961](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10961) Adds support for unlimited max connections for gateway listeners by allowing
  infinity as a valid value for the `max_connections` field in the configuration
  and HTTP API

- [#10985](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10985) Renamed emqx ctl command 'cluster_call' to 'conf cluster_sync'.
  The old command 'cluster_call' is still a valid command, but not included in usage info.

- [#11034](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11034) Hide the broker and move the `broker.shared_subscription_strategy` to `mqtt.shared_subscription_strategy` as it belongs to `mqtt`.

- [#11045](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11045) The listener's authentication and zone related apis have been officially removed in version `5.1.0`.

- [#11062](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11062) Rename `log.file.to` to `log.file.path`.

- [#10924](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10924) Refactored influxdb bridge connector to avoid resource leaks during crashes at creation.

- [#10944](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10944) Improved the GCP PubSub bridge to avoid a potential issue where messages could fail to be sent when restarting a node.

- [#10970](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10970) A query_mode parameter has been added to the Kafka producer bridge. This parameter allows you to specify if the bridge should use the asynchronous or synchronous mode when sending data to Kafka. The default is asynchronous mode.

- [#11003](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11003) Add an option to configure TCP keepalive in Kafka bridge.

- [#10690](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10690) Added a retry mechanism to webhook bridge that attempts to improve throughput.

  This optimization retries request failures without blocking the buffering layer, which can improve throughput in situations of high messaging rate.

- [#10698](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10698) Optimize memory usage when accessing the configuration during runtime.

- [#10754](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10754) The MQTT bridge has been enhanced to utilize connection pooling and leverage available parallelism, substantially improving throughput.

  As a consequence, single MQTT bridge now uses a pool of `clientid`s to connect to the remote broker.

- [#10790](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10790) Reducing overhead of reading configs per zone.


- [#10941](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10941) Improve the collection speed of Prometheus metrics when setting

- [#10715](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10715) Postpone trimming the connection information structure until after `client.connected` hooks have been executed. These hooks once again have access to the client's peer certificate.

- [#10737](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10737) Fix the issue where the HTTP API interface of Gateway cannot handle ClientIDs with
  special characters, such as: `!@#$%^&*()_+{}:"<>?/`.

- [#10785](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10785) Ensure `EMQX_LOG_DIR` is set by Windows boot script.

  The environment variable `EMQX_LOG_DIR` was missing in v5.0.25, caused EMQX Windows package fail to boot unless set by sysadmin.

- [#10809](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10809) Address  `** ERROR ** Mnesia post_commit hook failed: error:badarg` error messages happening during node shutdown or restart.

- [#10820](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10820) In case the cluster updated license before the new node join in. The new node will not apply the updated license.
  After this change, the new joined node will use the cluster's license key.

  Sometimes the new node must start with a outdated license.
  e.g. use emqx-operator deployed and needed to scale up after license expired.
  At the time the cluster's license key already updated by API/CLI, but the new node won't use it.

- [#10833](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10833) Only include enabled authenticators and authorizers in telemetry report, not all of them.

- [#10851](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10851) Obfuscated sensitive data in the bad API logging.

- [#10871](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10871) Fixes for connection deletion and message publishing requests not taking effect
  issues once the connection has been created in a different UDP port first.

- [#10884](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10884) Fixes an issue where trying to get rule info or metrics could result in a crash when a node is joining a cluster.

- [#10887](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10887) Fixed a potential issue where requests to bridges might take a long time to be retried.

  This only affected low throughput scenarios, where the buffering layer could take a long time to detect connectivity and driver problems.

- [#10902](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10902) Avoid syncing cluser.hocon file from the nodes runing a newer version than self.

  During cluster rolling upgrade, if an older version node has to restart due to whatever reason,
  if it copies the cluster.hocon file from a newer version node, it may fail to start.
  After this fix, the older version node will not copy the cluster.hocon file from a newer,
  so it will use its own cluster.hocon file to start.

- [#10911](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10911) The error message and log entry that appear when one tries to create a bridge with a name the exceeds 255 bytes is now easier to understand.

- [#10923](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10923) Fix a race-condition in channel info registration.

  Prior to this fix, when system is under heavy load, it might happen that a client is disconnected (or has its session expired) but still can be found in the clients page in dashboard.
  One of the possible reasons is a race condition fixed in this PR: the connection is killed in the middle of channel data registration.

- [#10930](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10930) Added a schema validation for values that might be used in timeouts to avoid invalid values.

  Before this fix, it was possible to use absurd values in the schema that would exceed the system limit, causing a crash.

- [#10943](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10943) Deprecated UDP mcast mechanism for cluster discovery.

  This feature has been planed for deprecation since 5.0 mainly due to the lack of
  actual production use.
  This feature code is not yet removed in 5.1, but the document interface is demoted.

- [#10950](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10950) Fix the issue where the `enable_qos` option does not take effect in the MQTT-SN gateway.

- [#10951](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10951) Fix the issue in MQTT-SN gateway where the `mountpoint` does not take effect on message publishing.

- [#10952](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10952) Disallow enabling `fail_if_no_peer_cert` in listener SSL options if `verify_none` is set.

  Setting `fail_if_no_peer_cert = true` and `verify = verify_none` caused connection errors
  due to incompatible options.
  This fix validates the options when creating or updating a listener to avoid these errors.

  Note: any old listener configuration with `fail_if_no_peer_cert = true` and `verify = verify_none`
  that was previously allowed will fail to load after applying this fix and must be manually fixed.

- [#10955](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10955) Fix the issue in MQTT-SN gateway where deleting Predefined Topics configuration does not work.

- [#10977](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10977) Fix delay in updating subscription count metric and correct configuration issues in Stomp gateway.

- [#10983](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10983) Fix issue when mqtt clients could not connect over TLS if the listener was configured to use TLS v1.3 only.

  The problem was that TLS connection was trying to use options incompatible with TLS v1.3.

- [#10994](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10994) Redact `proxy-authorization` headers as used by HTTP connector to not leak secrets into log-files.

- [#10996](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10996) Default to 404 for any HTTP/API request, we don't know, rather than the dashboard's index.html.

- [#11005](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11005) Fix the issue where the `method` field cannot be correctly printed in the trace logs of AuthN HTTP.

- [#11018](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11018) Fixed multiple issues with the Stomp gateway, including:
  - Fixed an issue where `is_superuser` was not working correctly.
  - Fixed an issue where the mountpoint was not being removed in message delivery.
  - After a message or subscription request fails, the Stomp client should be disconnected
  immediately after replying with an ERROR message.

- [#11028](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11028) Disallow using multiple TLS versions in the listener config that include tlsv1.3 but exclude tlsv1.2.

  Using TLS configuration with such version gap caused connection errors.
  Additionally, drop and log TLS options that are incompatible with the selected TLS version(s).

  Note: any old listener configuration with the version gap described above will fail to load
  after applying this fix and must be manually fixed.

- [#11030](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11030) Improved error messages when a validation error occurs while using the Listeners HTTP API.

- [#11033](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11033) Deprecates the `mountpoint` field in `AuthenticateRequest` in ExProto gateway.

  This field was introduced in v4.x, but in fact, in 5.0 we have provided
  `gateway.exproto.mountpoint` for configuration, so there is no need to override
  it through the Authenticate request.

  Additionally, updates the default value of `subscriptions_max`, `inflight_max`,
  `mqueue_max` to `infinity`

- [#11042](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11042) Fix crash on `/api/listeners` when listener's max_connections is set to a string.

- [#11051](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11051) Add validation to ensure that certificate 'depth' (listener SSL option) is a non negative integer.

- [#11056](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11056) - Fix the issue where newly created listeners do not start properly at times,
  when you delete a system default listener and add a new one named 'default', it will not start correctly.
  - Fix the bug where configuration failure on certain nodes can cause dashboard unavailability.

- [#11070](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11070) Fix the problem that the cluster.autoclean configuration item does not take effect.

- [#11092](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11092) Fix problem when replicants were unable to connect to the core node due to timeout in `mria_lb:core_nodes()` call.

- [#10967](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10967) Fixed error message formatting in rebalance API: previously they could be displayed as unclear dumps of internal Erlang structures.

  Added `wait_health_check` option to node evacuation CLI and API. This is a time interval when the node reports "unhealthy status" without beginning actual evacuation. We need this to allow a Load Balancer (if any) to remove the evacuated node from balancing and not forward (re)connecting clients to the evacuated node.

- [#10997](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10997) The ClickHouse bridge had a problem that could cause messages to be dropped when the ClickHouse server is closed while sending messages even when the request_ttl is set to infinity. This has been fixed by treating errors due to a closed connection as recoverable errors.

- [#10998](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10998) Do not allow `batch_size` option for MongoDB bridge resource.
  MongoDB connector currently does not support batching, the `bath_size` config value is forced to be 1 if provided.

- [#10999](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10999) Changed schema validation for Kafka fields 'Partition Count Refresh Interval' and 'Offset Commit Interval' to avoid accepting values larger then maximum allowed.

- [#11006](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11006) Fix QUIC listeners's default cert file paths.

  Prior to this change, the default cert file paths are prefixed with environment variable `${EMQX_ETC_DIR}` which were not interpolated before used in QUIC listeners.

- [#11025](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11025) Fixed a `case_clause` error that could arise in race conditions in Pulsar Producer bridge.

- [#11031](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11031) Fixed credential validation when creating bridge and checking status for InfluxDB Bridges.

- [#11038](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11038) Fixed a health check issue for Pulsar Producer that could lead to loss of messages when the connection to Pulsar's brokers were down.

- [#11040](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11040) Fixed a health check issue for Kafka Producer that could lead to loss of messages when the connection to Kafka's brokers were down.
