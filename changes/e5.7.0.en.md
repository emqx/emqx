# e5.7.0

## Enhancements

#### MQTT

Implemented Durable Sessions, which persists MQTT Persistent Sessions and their messages to disk, and continuously replicates session metadata and MQTT messages among multiple nodes in the EMQX cluster. This achieves effective failover and recovery mechanisms, ensuring service continuity and high availability, thereby enhancing system reliability.

Added metrics related to EMQX durable storage to Prometheus:

- `emqx_ds_egress_batches`
- `emqx_ds_egress_batches_retry`
- `emqx_ds_egress_batches_failed`
- `emqx_ds_egress_messages`
- `emqx_ds_egress_bytes`
- `emqx_ds_egress_flush_time`
- `emqx_ds_store_batch_time`
- `emqx_ds_builtin_next_time`
- `emqx_ds_storage_bitfield_lts_counter_seek`
- `emqx_ds_storage_bitfield_lts_counter_next`
- `emqx_ds_storage_bitfield_lts_counter_collision`

Note: these metrics are only visible when session persistence is enabled.
The number of persisted messages has also been added to the Dashboard.

#### Security

- [#12947](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12947) For JWT authentication, support new `disconnect_after_expire` option. When enabled, the client will be disconnected after the JWT token expires.

Note: This is a breaking change. This option is enabled by default, so the default behavior is changed. Previously, the clients with actual JWTs could connect to the broker and stay connected even after the JWT token expired. Now, the client will be disconnected after the JWT token expires. To preserve the previous behavior, set `disconnect_after_expire` to `false`.

#### Data Processing and Integration

- [#12711](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12711) Added schema validation feature. With this feature, once validations are configured for certain topic filters, the configured checks are run against published messages. If the checking results are not accepted by validation, the message is dropped and the client may be disconnected, depending on the configuration.

- [#12899](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12899) For RocketMQ data integration, added support for namespace and key dispatch strategy.

- [#12671](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12671) An `unescape` function has been added to the rule engine SQL language to handle the expansion of escape sequences in strings. This addition has been done because string literals in the SQL language don't support any escape codes (e.g., `\n` and `\t`). This enhancement allows for more flexible string manipulation within SQL expressions.

- [#12898](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12898) IoTDB bridge support for iotdb 1.3.0 and batch insert(batch_size/batch_time) options.

- [#12934](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12934) Added CSV format file aggregation for AWS S3 action.

#### Observability

- [#12827](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12827) It is now possible to trace rules with a new Rule ID trace filter as well as with the Client ID filter. For testing purposes, it is now also possible to use a new HTTP API endpoint (rules/:id/test) to artificially apply a rule and optionally stop its actions after they have been rendered.

- [#12863](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12863) You can now format trace log entries as JSON objects by setting the formatter parameter to "json" when creating the trace pattern.

- [#12880](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12880) Fixed the issue where serialization failed when the value in the tag set used a literal value (int or float) in the influxdb action configuration.
  Which Tag Set value's type is always `String`. See also: [Line Protocol - Tag Set](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2/reference/syntax/line-protocol/#tag-set)

- [#12844](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12844) CPU usage/idle statistics values are only retained with 2 decimal precision. This affects Prometheus statistical metrics and OpenTelemetry governance metrics.

#### Extensibility

- [#12872](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12872) Implemented Client Attributes feature. It allows setting additional properties for each client using key-value pairs. Property values can be generated from MQTT client connection information (such as username, client ID, TLS certificate) or set from data accompanying successful authentication returns. Properties can be used in EMQX for authentication, authorization, data integration, and MQTT extension functions. Compared to using static properties like client ID directly, client properties offer greater flexibility in various business scenarios, simplifying the development process and enhancing adaptability and efficiency in development work.

  **Initialization of `client_attrs`**

  The `client_attrs` fields can be initially populated from one of the following `clientinfo` fields:

    - `cn`: The common name from the TLS client's certificate.
    - `dn`: The distinguished name from the TLS client's certificate, that is, the certificate "Subject".
    - `clientid`: The MQTT client ID provided by the client.
    - `username`: The username provided by the client.
    - `user_property`: Extract a property value from 'User-Property' of the MQTT CONNECT packet.

  **Extension through Authentication Responses**

  Additional attributes may be merged into `client_attrs` from authentication responses. Supported
  authentication backends include:

    - **HTTP**: Attributes can be included in the JSON object of the HTTP response body through a
      `client_attrs` field.

    - **JWT**: Attributes can be included via a `client_attrs` claim within the JWT.

  **Usage in Authentication and Authorization**

  If `client_attrs` is initialized before authentication, it can be used in external authentication
  requests. For instance, `${client_attrs.property1}` can be used within request templates
    directed at an HTTP server for authenticity validation.

    - The `client_attrs` can be utilized in authorization configurations or request templates, enhancing
      flexibility and control. Examples include: In `acl.conf`, use `{allow, all, all, ["${client_attrs.namespace}/#"]}` to apply permissions based on the `namespace` attribute.

    - In other authorization backends, `${client_attrs.namespace}` can be used within request templates to dynamically include client attributes.

- [#12910](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12910) Added plugin configuration management and schema validation. It is also possible to annotate the schema with metadata to facilitate UI rendering in the Dashboard. See more details in the [plugin template](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-plugin-template/pull/126) and [plugin documentation](../extensions/plugins.md).

#### Operations and Management

- [#12923](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12923) Provided more specific error when importing wrong format into builtin authenticate database.

- [#12940](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12940) Added `ignore_readonly` argument to `PUT /configs` API.

  Before this change, EMQX would return 400 (BAD_REQUEST) if the raw config included read-only root keys (`cluster`, `rpc`, and `node`).

  After this enhancement it can be called as `PUT /configs?ignore_readonly=true`, EMQX will in this case ignore readonly root config keys, and apply the rest. For observability purposes, an info level message is logged if any readonly keys are dropped.

  Also fixed an exception when config has bad HOCON syntax (returns 500). Now bad syntax will cause the API to return 400 (BAD_REQUEST).

- [#12957](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12957) Started building packages for macOS 14 (Apple Silicon) and Ubuntu 24.04 Noble Numbat (LTS).

- [#12883](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12883) Added REST API endpoints and CLI commands for durable storage management.

	New REST endpoints:

	- `/ds/sites`
	- `/ds/sites/:site`
	- `/ds/storages`
	- `/ds/storages/:ds`
	- `/ds/storages/:ds/replicas`
	- `/ds/storages/:ds/replicas/:site`

	New CLI commands:

	- `ds set_replicas`
	- `ds join`
	- `ds leave`

## Bug Fixes

#### Security

- [#12887](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12887) Fixed MQTT enhanced auth with sasl scram.

- [#12962](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12962) TLS clients can now verify server hostname against wildcard certificate. For example, if a certificate is issued for host `*.example.com`, TLS clients is able to verify server hostnames like `srv1.example.com`.

#### MQTT

- [#12996](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12996) Fixed process leak in `emqx_retainer` application. Previously, client disconnection while receiving retained messages could cause a process leak.

- [#12855](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12855) Fix when the client subscribes/unsubscribes to a shared topic, the system topic messages for Client subscribed/unsubscribed notification cannot be serialized correctly.
Fix the `$queue` shared topics format error in endpoint `/topics`.

- [#12976](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12976) Fix the `client.disconnected` event being triggered when taking over a session that the socket has been disconnected before.

#### Data Processing and Integration

- [#12653](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12653) The rule engine function `bin2hexstr` now supports bitstring inputs with a bit size that is not divisible by 8. Such bitstrings can be returned by the rule engine function `subbits`.

- [#12657](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12657) The rule engine SQL-based language previously did not allow putting any expressions as array elements in array literals (only constants and variable references were allowed). This has now been fixed so that one can use any expressions as array elements.

  The following is now permitted, for example:

  ```bash
  select
  [21 + 21, abs(-abs(-2)), [1 + 1], 4] as my_array
  from "t/#"
  ```

- [#12932](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12932) Previously, if a HTTP action request received a 503 (Service Unavailable) status, it was marked as a failure and the request was not retried. This has now been fixed so that the request is retried a configurable number of times.

- [#12948](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12948) Fixed an issue where sensitive HTTP header values like `Authorization` would be substituted by `******` after updating a connector.

- [#12895](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12895) Added some missing config keys for the DynamoDB connector and the action.

- [#13018](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13018) Reduced log spamming when connection goes down in a Postgres/Timescale/Matrix connector.

- [#13118](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13118) Fix a performance issue in the rule engine template rendering.

#### Observability

- [#12765](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12765) Make sure stats `subscribers.count` `subscribers.max` contains shared-subscribers. It only contains non-shared subscribers previously.

#### Operations and Management

- [#12812](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12812) Made resource health checks non-blocking operations.  This means that operations such as updating or removing a resource won't be blocked by a lengthy running health check.

- [#12830](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12830) Made channel (action/source) health checks non-blocking operations. This means that operations such as updating or removing an action/source data integration won't be blocked by a lengthy running health check.

- [#12993](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12993) Fixed listener config update API when handling an unknown zone.

  Before this fix, when a listener config is updated with an unknown zone, for example `{"zone": "unknown"}`, the change would be accepted, causing all clients to crash when connected.
  After this fix, updating the listener with an unknown zone name will get a "Bad request" response.

- [#13012](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13012) The MQTT listerners config option `access_rules` has been improved in the following ways:

  * The listener no longer crash with an incomprehensible error message if a non-valid access rule is configured. Instead a configuration error is generated.
  * One can now add several rules in a single string by separating them by comma (for example, "allow 10.0.1.0/24, deny all").

- [#13041](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13041) Improved HTTP authentication error log message. If HTTP content-type header is missing for POST method, it now emits a meaningful error message instead of a less readable exception with stack trace.

- [#13077](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13077) This fix makes EMQX only read action configurations from the global configuration when the connector starts or restarts, and instead stores the latest configurations for the actions in the connector. Previously, updates to action configurations would sometimes not take effect without disabling and enabling the action. This means that an action could sometimes run with the old (previous) configuration even though it would look like the action configuration has been updated successfully.

- [#13090](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13090) Attempting to start an action or source whose connector is disabled will no longer attempt to start the connector itself.

- [#12871](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12871) Fixed startup process of evacuated node. Previously, if a node was evacuated and stoped without stopping evacuation, it would not start back.

- [#12888](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12888) Fixed License related configuration loss after importing backup data.

#### Gateways

- [#12902](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12902) Pass the Content-type of MQTT message to the Stomp message.

- [#12909](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12909) Fixed UDP listener process handling on errors or closure, The fix ensures the UDP listener is cleanly stopped and restarted as needed if these error conditions occur.

- [#13001](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13001) Fixed an issue where the syskeeper forwarder would never reconnect when the connection was lost.

- [#13010](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13010) Fixed the issue where the JT/T 808 gateway could not correctly reply to the REGISTER_ACK message when requesting authentication from the registration service failed.

## Breaking Changes

- [#12947](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12947) For JWT authentication, a new boolean option `disconnect_after_expire` has been added with default value set to `true`. When enabled, the client will be disconnected after the JWT token expires.

  Previously, the clients with actual JWTs could connect to the broker and stay connected even after the JWT token expired. Now, the client will be disconnected after the JWT token expires. To preserve the previous behavior, set `disconnect_after_expire` to `false`.
  
- [#12957](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12957) Stopped building packages for macOS 12.

- [#12895](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12895) Complemented some necessary but missed keys for the DynamoDB connector and the action. The old configuration is obsolete, as it didn't function properly before this fix. Specifically, for the DynamoDB connector, the addition of a new key, `region`, is required. Additionally, `hash_key` and `range_key` are now supported in the DynamoDB action, with `hash_key` being mandatory.
