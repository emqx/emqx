"""Retainer index specifications: list of arrays of positive ascending integers.
Each array specifies an index. Numbers in an index specification are 1-based
word positions in topics. Words from specified positions will be used for indexing.<br/>
For example, it is good to have <code>[2, 4]</code> index to optimize
<code>+/X/+/Y/...</code> topic wildcard subscriptions."""

batch_deliver_limiter.desc:
"""The rate limiter name for retained messages' delivery.
Limiter helps to avoid delivering too many messages to the client at once, which may cause the client to block or crash, or drop messages due to exceeding the size of the message queue.
The names of the available rate limiters are taken from the existing rate limiters under `limiter.batch`.
If this field is empty, limiter is not used."""

msg_expiry_interval_override.desc:
"""If set, this value will take precedence over any `Message-Expiry-Interval` property specified in retained MQTT messages, allowing messages to expire earlier if necessary.  This override only applies to the garbage collection process: it does not affect the expiry time of messages being written nor that of already written messages while iterating over them.  Therefore, messages that are candidate for garbage collection when overridden may still be visible when subscribing to retained topics."""
