# EMQX 4.4 Changes

## v4.4.10

### Bug fixes  (synced from v4.3.21)

- Fix the latency statistics error of the slow subscription module when `stats_type` is `internal` or `response`. [#8981](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8981)

## v4.4.9

### Bug fixes  (synced from v4.3.20)

- Fix rule-engine update behaviour which may initialize actions for disabled rules. [#8849](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8849)
- Fix JWT plugin don't support non-integer timestamp claims. [#8862](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8862)
- Fix a possible dead loop caused by shared subscriptions with `shared_dispatch_ack_enabled=true`. [#8918](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8918)
- Fix dashboard binding IP address not working. [#8916](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8916)
- Fix rule SQL topic matching to null values failed. [#8927](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8927)
  The following SQL should not fail (crash) but return `{"r": false}`:
  `SELECT topic =~ 't' as r FROM "$events/client_connected"`.
  The topic is a null value as there's no such field in event `$events/client_connected`, so it
  should return false if match it to a topic.

## v4.4.8

### Enhancements (synced from v4.3.19)
* Support HTTP API `/trace/:name/detail`.

### Bug fixes
- Fix: Check if emqx_mod_trace is enabled when the trace file is not found.

### Enhancements (synced from v4.3.19)

- Improve error message for LwM2M plugin when object ID is not valid. [#8654](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8654).
- Add tzdata apk package to alpine docker image. [#8671](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8671)
- Refine Rule Engine error log. RuleId will be logged when take action failed. [#8737](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8737)
- Increases the latency interval for MQTT Bridge test connections to improve compatibility in high-latency environments. [#8745](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8745)
- Close ExProto client process immediately if it's keepalive timeouted. [#8725](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8725)

- Improved jwt authentication module initialization process. [#8736](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8736)

### Bug fixes (synced from v4.3.19)

- Fix rule SQL compare to null values always returns false. [#8743](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8743)
  Before this change, the following SQL failed to match on the WHERE clause (`clientid != foo` returns false):
  `SELECT 'some_var' as clientid FROM "t" WHERE clientid != foo`.
  The `foo` variable is a null value, so `clientid != foo` should be evaluated as true.
- Fix GET `/auth_clientid` and `/auth_username` counts. [#8655](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8655)
- Add an idle timer for ExProto UDP client to avoid client leaking [#8628](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8628)

* Add support for JWT authorization [#7596]
  Now MQTT clients may be authorized with respect to a specific claim containing publish/subscribe topic whitelists.
* Better randomisation of app screts (changed from timestamp seeded sha hash (uuid) to crypto:strong_rand_bytes)
* Return a client_identifier_not_valid error when username is empty and username_as_clientid is set to true [#7862]
* Add more rule engine date functions: format_date/3, format_date/4, date_to_unix_ts/4 [#7894]

## v4.4.3

** NOTE**: v4.4.3 is in sync with v4.3.14

### Enhancements
* Add rule events: client.connack, client.check_acl_complete
- client.connack The rule event is triggered when the server sends a CONNACK packet to the client. reason_code contains the error reason code.
- client.check_acl_complete The rule event is triggered when the client check acl complete.

### Enhancements (synced from v4.3.14)

* Add `RequestMeta` for exhook.proto in order to expose `cluster_name` of emqx in each gRPC request. [#7524]
* Support customize emqx_exhook execution priority. [#7408]

  This api reset the metrics of the rule engine of a rule, and reset the metrics of the action related to this rule. [#7474]
* Enhanced rule engine error handling when json parsing error.
* Add support for `RSA-PSK-AES256-GCM-SHA384`, `RSA-PSK-AES256-CBC-SHA384`,
 `RSA-PSK-AES128-GCM-SHA256`, `RSA-PSK-AES128-CBC-SHA256` PSK ciphers, and remove `PSK-3DES-EDE-CBC-SHA`,
 `PSK-RC4-SHA` from the default configuration. [#7427]
* Diagnostic logging for mnesia `wait_for_table`
  - prints check points of mnesia internal stats
  - prints check points of per table loading stats
  Help to locate the problem of long table loading time.
* Add `local` strategy for Shared Subscription.
  That will preferentially dispatch messages to a shared subscriber at the same
  node. It will improves the efficiency of shared messages dispatching in certain
  scenarios, especially when the emqx-bridge-mqtt plugin is configured as shared
  subscription. [#7462]

* Update mongodb driver to fix potential process leak.
* Fix a potential security issue #3155 with emqx-dashboard plugin.
  In the earlier implementation, the Dashboard password is reset back to the
  default value of emqx_dashboard.conf after the node left cluster.
  Now we persist changed password to protect against reset. [#7518]
* Silence grep/sed warnings in docker-entrypoint.sh. [#7520]
* Generate `loaded_modules` and `loaded_plugins` files with default values when no such files exists. [#7520]
* Fix the configuration `server_name_indication` set to disable does not take effect.
* Fix backup files are not deleted and downloaded correctly when the API path has ISO8859-1 escape characters.


## v4.4.2

**NOTE**: v4.4.2 is in sync with: v4.3.13

### Important changes

* Docker image is based on alpine-3.15.1 (OpenSSL-1.1.1n)
* For docker image, /opt/emqx/etc has been removed from the VOLUME list,
  this made it easier for the users to rebuild image on top with changed configs.
* CentOS 7 Erlang runtime is rebuilt on OpenSSL-1.1.1n (previously on 1.0),
  Prior to v4.4.1, EMQX may pick certain cipher suites proposed by the clients,
  but then fail to handshake resulting in a `malformed_handshake_data` exception.

### Enhancements

* Windows package is built on Erlang/OTP 24

### Enhancements (synced from v4.3.13)

* CLI `emqx_ctl pem_cache clean` to force purge x509 certificate cache,
  to force an immediate reload of all certificates after the files are updated on disk.
* Refactor the ExProto so that anonymous clients can also be displayed on the dashboard [#6983]
* Force shutdown of processes that cannot answer takeover event [#7026]
* Support set keepalive via queryString & Body HTTP API.
* `topic` parameter in bridge configuration can have `${node}` substitution (just like in `clientid` parameter)
* Add UTF-8 string validity check in `strict_mode` for MQTT packet.
  When set to true, invalid UTF-8 strings will cause the client to be disconnected. i.e. client ID, topic name. [#7261]
* Changed systemd service restart delay from 10 seconds to 60 seconds.
* MQTT-SN gateway supports initiative to synchronize registered topics after session resumed. [#7300]
* Add load control app for future development.

* Fix the ExProto connection registry is not released after the client process abnormally exits [#6983]
* Fix Server-KeepAlive wrongly applied on MQTT v3.0/v3.1 [#7085]
* Fix Stomp client can not trigger `$event/client_connection` message [#7096]
* Fix system memory false alarm at boot

* Send DISCONNECT packet with reason code 0x98 if connection has been kicked [#7309]
* Fix make all traces stopped when emqx_trace_module is disabled.

## v4.4.1

This patch release is only to fix windows build which failed on v4.4.0.

## v4.4.0

**NOTE**: v4.4.0 is in sync with: v4.3.12

### Important changes

- **For Debian/Ubuntu users**, Debian/Ubuntu package (deb) installed EMQX is now started from systemd.
  This is to use systemd's supervision functionality to ensure that EMQX service restarts after a crash.
  The package installation service upgrade from init.d to systemd has been verified,
  it is still recommended that you verify and confirm again before deploying to the production environment,
  at least to ensure that systemd is available in your system

- Package name scheme changed comparing to 4.3.
  4.3 format: emqx-centos8-4.3.8-amd64.zip
  4.4 format: emqx-4.4.0-rc.1-otp24.1.5-3-el8-amd64.zip
  * Erlang/OTP version is included in the package name,
    providing the possibility to release EMQX on multiple Erlang/OTP versions
  * `centos` is renamed to `el`. This is mainly due to centos8 being dead (replaced with rockylinux8)

- MongoDB authentication supports DNS SRV and TXT Records resolution, which can seamlessly connect with MongoDB Altas

- Support dynamic modification of MQTT Keep Alive to adapt to different energy consumption strategies.

- Support 4.3 to 4.4 rolling upgrade of clustered nodes. See upgrade document for more dtails.

- TLS for cluster backplane (RPC) connections. See clustering document for more details.

- Support real-time tracing in the dashboard, with Client ID, Client IP address, and topic name based filtering.

- Add the Slow Subscriptions module to count the time spent during the message transmission. This feature will list the Clients and Topics with higher time consumption in Dashboard

### Minor changes

- Bumpped default boot wait time from 15 seconds to 150 seconds
  because in some simulated environments it may take up to 70 seconds to boot in build CI

- Dashboard supports relative paths and custom access paths

- Supports configuring whether to forward retained messages with empty payload to suit users
  who are still using MQTT v3.1. The relevant configurable item is `retainer.stop_publish_clear_msg`

- Multi-language hook extension (ExHook) supports dynamic cancellation of subsequent forwarding of client messages

- Rule engine SQL supports the use of single quotes in `FROM` clauses, for example: `SELECT * FROM 't/#'`

- Change the default value of the `max_topic_levels` configurable item to 128.
  Previously, it had no limit (configured to 0), which may be a potential DoS threat

- Improve the error log content when the Proxy Protocol message is received without `proxy_protocol` configured.

- Add additional message attributes to the message reported by the gateway.
  Messages from gateways such as CoAP, LwM2M, Stomp, ExProto, etc., when converted to EMQX messages,
  add fields such as protocol name, protocol version, user name, client IP, etc.,
  which can be used for multi-language hook extension (ExHook)

- HTTP client performance improvement

- Add openssl-1.1 to RPM dependency
