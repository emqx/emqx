## NOTE:
## This config file overrides data/configs/cluster.hocon,
## and is merged with environment variables which start with 'EMQX_' prefix.
##
## Config changes made from EMQX dashboard UI, management HTTP API, or CLI
## are stored in data/configs/cluster.hocon.
## To avoid confusion, please do not store the same configs in both files.
##
## See {{ emqx_configuration_doc }} for more details.
## Configuration full example can be found in etc/examples
