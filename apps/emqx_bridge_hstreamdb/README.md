# EMQX HStreamDB Bridge

[HStreamDB](https://hstream.io/) is streaming database purpose-built to ingest,
store, process, and analyze massive data streams. It is a modern data infrastructure
that unifies messaging, stream processing, and storage to help get value out of
your data in real-time.

The application is used to connect EMQX and HStreamDB.
User can create a rule and easily ingest IoT data into HStreamDB by leveraging
[EMQX Rules](https://docs.emqx.com/en/enterprise/v5.0/data-integration/rules.html).
