%% NOTE: this is the release version which is not always the same
%% as the emqx app version defined in emqx.app.src
%% App (plugin) versions are bumped independently.
%% e.g. EMQX_RELEASE_CE being 4.3.1 does no always imply emqx app
%% should be 4.3.1, as it might be the case that only one of the
%% plugins had a bug to fix. So for a hot beam upgrade, only the app
%% with beam files changed needs an upgrade.

%% NOTE: This version number should be manually bumped for each release

%% NOTE: This version number should have 3 numeric parts
%% (Major.Minor.Patch), and extra info can be added after a final
%% hyphen.

%% NOTE: ALso make sure to follow the instructions in end of
%% `apps/emqx/src/bpapi/README.md'

%% Opensource edition
-define(EMQX_RELEASE_CE, "5.8.6-hotfix2").

%% Enterprise edition
-define(EMQX_RELEASE_EE, "5.8.6-hotfix2").
