# This is an example of how to configure the "title-max-length" rule and
# set the line-length it enforces to 80
# [title-max-length]
# line-length=50

# Conversely, you can also enforce minimal length of a title with the
# "title-min-length" rule:
# [title-min-length]
# min-length=5

# [title-must-not-contain-word]
# Comma-separated list of words that should not occur in the title. Matching is case
# insensitive. It's fine if the keyword occurs as part of a larger word (so "WIPING"
# will not cause a violation, but "WIP: my title" will.
# words=wip

[title-match-regex]
# python-style regex that the commit-msg title must match
# Note that the regex can contradict with other rules if not used correctly
# (e.g. title-must-not-contain-word).
regex=^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|build|ci|revert|chore|perf)(\(.+\))*: .+

# [body-max-line-length]
# line-length=72

# [body-min-length]
# min-length=5

# [body-is-missing]
# Whether to ignore this rule on merge commits (which typically only have a title)
# default = True
# ignore-merge-commits=false

# [body-changed-file-mention]
# List of files that need to be explicitly mentioned in the body when they are changed
# This is useful for when developers often erroneously edit certain files or git submodules.
# By specifying this rule, developers can only change the file when they explicitly reference
# it in the commit message.
# files=gitlint/rules.py,README.md

# [body-match-regex]
# python-style regex that the commit-msg body must match.
# E.g. body must end in My-Commit-Tag: foo
# regex=My-Commit-Tag: foo$

# [author-valid-email]
# python-style regex that the commit author email address must match.
# For example, use the following regex if you only want to allow email addresses from foo.com
# regex=[^@]+@foo.com

[ignore-by-title]
# Ignore certain rules for commits of which the title matches a regex
# E.g. Match commit titles that start with "Release"
# regex=^Release(.*)

# Ignore certain rules, you can reference them by their id or by their full name
# Use 'all' to ignore all rules
# ignore=T1,body-min-length

[ignore-by-body]
# Ignore certain rules for commits of which the body has a line that matches a regex
# E.g. Match bodies that have a line that that contain "release"
# regex=(.*)release(.*)
#
# Ignore certain rules, you can reference them by their id or by their full name
# Use 'all' to ignore all rules
# ignore=T1,body-min-length

# [ignore-body-lines]
# Ignore certain lines in a commit body that match a regex.
# E.g. Ignore all lines that start with 'Co-Authored-By'
# regex=^Co-Authored-By

# This is a contrib rule - a community contributed rule. These are disabled by default.
# You need to explicitly enable them one-by-one by adding them to the "contrib" option
# under [general] section above.
# [contrib-title-conventional-commits]
# Specify allowed commit types. For details see: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/
# types = bugfix,user-story,epic
